## [Learning to Reinforcement learn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05763.pdf)

TLDR; 

### Key Points
- Seen from previous work is that recurrent neural networks can support metaRL in fully supervised context.
- The approach described in the paper, is by usage of RNN for the meta variables in similar fashion to RL^2.
- TODO

### Notes
Two of the earliest papers mentioned discussing the idea of meta-learning are (Schmidhuber et al., 1996; Thrun and Pratt, 1998). With (Thrun and Pratt, 1998) containing some theoretical notions of bounds. Also the idea of having an inner and outer loop for the meta-learning task.
